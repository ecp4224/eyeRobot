# eyeRobot Archive Python Module Code
This folder contains all code to implement a server module in Python. No part of
the project uses this so it was moved to the archive folder. This contains a
`ModuleClient` object that is similar to the `RobotClient` object, but acts
as a module instead of a robot. It includes a `module_example` script and a
`kinect_module` script. These are both custom modules that can connect to the
server and communicate with other modules on the server.
