# eyeRobot Archive Client Code
This folder contains all code related to the Raspberry Pi client that is
no longer used. These are mostly test scripts to test the different parts of
the robot. The files include

* kinect.c - This file was used to attempt to get the Raspberry Pi to get data
from the kinect and send it via UDP to the server
* server_test.py - This is a script that tests the `RobotClient` object
* test_gyro.py - This is a script that tests the gyroscope to ensure that it
works properly
* test_motor.py - This is a script that tests the motors and motor controller
to ensure that they are working properly
